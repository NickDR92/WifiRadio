# WifiRadio
This project contains all the python files to make a ethernet radio with a Raspberry Pi and a 20W amplifier from adafruit.

I bought the amplifier from adafruit and used there python code to install all the necessary libraries and some example code. 
Amplifier: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1752
Github amplifier: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MAX9744

Based on some example code from instructables I created this code. All the necessary code is found in main python file
